    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <hr/>
    <h2>Programming</h2>
    <p>This probably seems obvious. Jokes aside, I am passionate<br/>
    about learning programming, because it allows my creativity<br/>
    to sprout and to make something out of nothing.</p>
    
    <hr/>

    <h2>Motorcycles</h2>
    <p>I am really into motorcycles and just love the feeling of<br/>
    freedom. I will soon acquire a Ktm Duke 125(seen in the<br/>
    picture). Ktm is one of my favourite motorcycle brands.</p>
